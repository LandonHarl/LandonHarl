            <!-- Add as many paragraphs as you need. -->
            <p>As a member service employee, my job mainly consists of helping members with any questions they have.
                I sign people up for memberships, put them into groups such as swim lessons, classes, and youth sports, 
                and make sure they have the best experience they can get at our gym. I am responsible for sending people
                to the right spot for different departments. I do all of the payments for all of our members. I keep track 
                of the cameras to make sure no one is breaking rules or abusing our equipment.

            <p>
                As a flex worker, I did whatever was needed around the store. I ran registers, bagged, assisted customers, fulfilled online orders,
                and occasionally stocked and faced isles. My main job was the online orders. I would go to my app, and fulfill orders in the least
                amount of time possible. I would then tag them as complete, and my phone gave me a notifaction when the shopper arrived.
                I brought the items out to the shoppers, and started the next order.

            <p>
                My job consisted of cleaning, assisting customers and foldin clothes.
                I stocked when needed, but usually just made the store more presentable.

            <!-- Add as many paragraphs as you need. -->
            <p>
                At Hobby Lobby, I mainly cleaned the store everyday and assisted customers. I was usually scheduled 4 hours after school.
                On days I was scheduled longer, I would stock the store and build overheads as needed for more products to be set out.
                If someone ordered a big product, I would grab it from the stockroom and carry it out to their car for them.
